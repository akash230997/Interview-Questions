        </button>
        <div class="panel">

            Node.js is a single-process, single-threaded event driven programming language used to run js code in
            backend
            environment.Node.js applications are written in javascript and can be run within the node.js runtime on
            windows,linux etc.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 2.What is NPM?</button>
        <div class="panel">

            NPM stands for the node package manager, npm is used for node dependency management.
            we use npm as a server-side node dependency tool
            NPM uses nested dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our code. Nested
            dependencies
            mean
            that any dependency is again dependent on another dependency npm: It is a package manager for the JavaScript
            programming language.
            It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. Help to manage a project’s
            dependencies. npm is installed with Node automatically.
            npm: NPM generates a ‘package-lock.json’ file. the package-lock will generate the same node_modules folder
            for
            different npm versions.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 3.What are the modules in Node.js?</button>
        <div class="panel">

            In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the
            basis
            of their related functionality.
            Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.
            The reason programmers are heavily reliant on modules is because of their re-usability as well as the
            ability to
            break down a complex piece of code into manageable chunks. Modules are of three types:
            Core Modules/Internal modules
            Local Modules/Custom modules
            Third-party Modules
            Core Modules: Node.js has many built-in modules that are part of the platform and comes with Node.js
            installation.
            These modules can be loaded into the program by using the require function. The require() function will
            return a
            JavaScript type depending on what the particular module returns. ex:- http creates an HTTP server in
            Node.js.
            Local Modules: Unlike built-in and external modules, local modules are created locally in your Node.js
            application.
            Let’s create a simple calculating module that calculates various operations. Another file can use its
            exported
            functionality using the require() function.
            Third-party modules: Third-party modules are modules that are available online using the Node Package
            Manager(NPM).
            These modules can be installed in the project folder or globally. Some of the popular third-party modules
            are
            mongoose, express, angular, and react.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 4.Difference between default export and named export.</button>
        <div class="panel">

            Difference between default export and named export.
            Export objects, functions, variables from the module so they can be used by other programs with the help of
            the
            import statements.
            There are two types of exports.
            1. Named Exports,
            2. Default Exports.
            Named Exports: Named exports are useful to export several values.
            During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.
            Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a single file and were
            introduced
            with
            the release of ES2015.
            Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must be imported using the name of the
            object,
            function or variable that was exported.

            Default Exports: Default exports are useful to export only a single object, function, variable. During the
            import,
            we can use any name to import.Exports without a default tag are Named exports. Exports with the default tag
            are
            Default exports.
            default export:- Using Named and Default Exports at the same time: It is possible to use Named and Default
            exports
            in the same file. It means both will be imported in the same file.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 5. How do you import any module in Node.js?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">

            Importing functions or modules enhances the reusability of code.
            Importing a Module: We need to import the module to use the functions defined in the imported module in
            another
            file. The result returned by require() is stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using
            the
            dot
            notation.
            const f = require('./func')
        </div>


        <button class="accordion"> Question- 6. What is the purpose of the module.exports?
        </button>
        <div class="panel">

            Module.exports is the instruction that tells Node. js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.)
            to
            “export” from a given file so other files are allowed to access the exported code.
            The module.exports is actually a property of the module object in node.js. module. Exports is the object
            that is
            returned to the require() call.
            By module.exports, we can export functions, objects, and their references from one file and can use them in
            other
            files by importing them by require() method. easy to maintain and manage the code base in different modules.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 1.What are the different types of HTTP requests??
        </button>
        <div class="panel">
            HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) specifies a collection of request methods to specify what action is to be
            performed on a particular resource. The most commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH,
            and DELETE. These are equivalent to the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). <br>
            <strong> GET:</strong> GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server. GET returns an HTTP
            status code of 200 (OK) if the data is successfully retrieved from the server. <br>
            <strong> POST: </strong>POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to
            the server. On successful creation, it returns an HTTP status code of 201. <br> <strong> PUT:</strong> A PUT
            request is used to
            modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is
            passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one. <br>
            <strong> PATCH:</strong>
            PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only
            replace the content that you want to update. <br> <strong> DELETE: </strong> A DELETE request is used to
            delete the data on the
            server at a specified location.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 2.Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.
        </button>
        <div class="panel">

            Express.js is a routing and Middleware framework for handling the different routing of the
            webpage and it
            works between the request and response cycle. Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request
            and before the controller actions send the response. Middleware has the access to the request object,
            responses object, and next, it can process the request before the server send a response. An Express-based
            application is a series of middleware function calls. Middleware Chaining: Middleware can be chained from
            one to another, Hence creating a chain of functions that are executed in order. The last function sends the
            response back to the browser. So, before sending the response back to the browser the different middleware
            processes the request. The next() function in the express is responsible for calling the next middleware
            function if there is one.

        <div class="panel">
            <strong> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing </strong> is a mechanism by which data or any other resource of a
            site could be shared
            intentionally to a third party website when there is a need. Generally, access to resources that are
            residing in a third party site is restricted by the browser clients for security purposes.

        <button class="accordion"> Question- 4.What is Express? How does it help you to create a backend
            application.</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <strong> Express.js:</strong> Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node.js’s web server
            functionality to simplify
            its APIs and add helpful new features. It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with
            middleware and routing. It adds helpful utilities to Node.js’s HTTP objects. It facilitates the rendering of
            dynamic HTTP objects. *More features than Node.js *It is used to build web-apps using approaches and
            principles of Node.js. *Routing is provided. *It requires less coding time. *Uses middleware for the
            arrangement of functions systematically server-side.

            An HTTP status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that
            request can be fulfilled. Status codes specs are set by the W3C. Status codes are embedded in the HTTP
            header of a page to tell the browser the result of its request.

        <div class="panel">
            HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to
            encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses. As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP. A website that
            uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://. Some difference of http and

        <div class="panel">
            <strong> JSON web token (JWT)</strong>, pronounced "jot", is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a
            compact and
            self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. Again, JWT is a
            standard, meaning that all JWTs are tokens, but not all tokens are JWTs. when we logged-in somewhere , they
            provide us a unique token.which helps us to access through it token is provided only when the registered
            data and login data are matching. Ex:-facebook
